🎬 Cinema Ticket Booking System (DSA)

This project is a simple cinema ticket booking system developed as a small academic project using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The main objective of this project is to apply core DSA concepts to simulate a real-world movie ticket booking process in a clear and structured way.

The system allows users to view available movies and show timings, book tickets, manage seat availability, and cancel bookings through a menu-driven interface. It focuses on logical flow, efficient data handling, and user-friendly interaction rather than advanced features.

This project uses basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or queues (depending on implementation) to manage bookings and ticket information. Searching and simple sorting techniques are applied to improve data access and organization.

The project helped me strengthen my understanding of DSA fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and how real-world systems can be modeled using data structures. It also improved my ability to write clean, readable, and structured code.

This system is intentionally kept simple and lightweight for learning purposes and serves as a foundation for future improvements such as file handling, graphical interfaces, or web-based ticket booking systems.
